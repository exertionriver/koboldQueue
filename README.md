Scenario: "You are a task-oriented fly on the wall of a spooky cave, observing the various behaviors of a rotating cast of kobolds.. some of them screech randomly, others appear to reflect upon their situation, and yet others appear to putter around a bit before leaving. Let's check in and see how your day is going.."
